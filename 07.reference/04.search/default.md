# Search

Dune includes a built-in full-text search engine that indexes all published, routable content at startup. It is available via the REST API and powers the admin panel's content search.

## How it works

Search uses an in-memory inverted index built from:

- Page **title** (boosted 3×)
- Page **taxonomy values** (boosted 2×)
- Page **body text** (stripped of Markdown/HTML syntax)
- Page **template** name
- Any **custom frontmatter fields** you add via `system.search.customFields`

The index is built once at startup (`dune serve`) or rebuilt on each content change in dev mode (`dune dev`). It is not persisted to disk — a restart triggers a full rebuild.

## Custom indexed fields

By default only the fields above are indexed. To make additional frontmatter fields searchable, list them in your system config:

```yaml
# config/system.yaml
search:
  customFields:
    - summary
    - author
    - series
```

Custom field values are extracted during index build alongside the page body — no extra file I/O. String values and arrays of strings are both supported.

## Query syntax

Queries are split into terms by whitespace. A term is a sequence of two or more non-punctuation characters. Single-character terms are ignored.

| Behaviour | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Single term | `deno` — matches pages containing "deno" |
| Multi-term (AND boost) | `deno fresh` — matches pages containing both; all-terms matches are ranked higher |
| Prefix matching | `dep` — also matches "deno", "deploy", "dependencies" |
| Case insensitive | `Deno` and `deno` produce identical results |

There is no special syntax for phrases, boolean operators, or field-specific searches. All terms are matched against the combined text field.

## Relevance scoring

Each result is assigned a score. Higher scores rank first.

| Signal | Score contribution |
|--------|-------------------|
| Term appears in title | +3 per term |
| Exact title match | +5 |
| Term appears in taxonomy value | +2 per match |
| Term appears in body | +1 per occurrence (capped at 5 per term) |
| All terms match | ×1.5 multiplier applied to total |

## REST API

### Full-text search (with filters)

```
GET /api/search
```

Query parameters:

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `q` | string | `""` | Search query |
| `template` | string | — | Filter by template name |
| `published` | `"true"` \| `"false"` | — | Filter by publish status |
| `lang` | string | — | Filter by language code |
| `from` | string (`YYYY-MM-DD`) | — | Filter pages with `date ≥ from` |
| `to` | string (`YYYY-MM-DD`) | — | Filter pages with `date ≤ to` |
| `taxonomy[{name}][]` | string | — | Filter by taxonomy value — repeatable |
| `limit` | number | 20 (max 100) | Maximum results to return |

Taxonomy filters use bracket notation and can be repeated:
```
GET /api/search?q=deno&taxonomy[tag][]=deno&taxonomy[tag][]=fresh&taxonomy[category][]=tutorial
```

Response:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "route": "/blog/hello-world",
      "title": "Hello World",
      "template": "post",
      "date": "2025-06-15",
      "taxonomy": { "tag": ["deno", "fresh"] },
      "score": 8.5,
      "excerpt": "...the Deno runtime makes it easy to..."
    }
  ],
  "total": 3,
  "query": "deno",
  "filters": {
    "template": null,
    "taxonomy": { "tag": ["deno"] }
  }
}
```

The `excerpt` field is a 120-character window around the first term match in the page body.

An empty query (`q=`) with no filters returns an empty `items` array — it does not return all pages.

### Autocomplete suggestions

```
GET /api/search/suggest?q={prefix}
```

Returns up to 10 completion suggestions for the given prefix. Scans the inverted index terms and page titles for prefix matches.

| Param | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `q` | string | Prefix typed by the user (minimum 2 characters) |

Response:

```json
{
  "suggestions": ["deno", "deploy", "dependencies", "Dune CMS", "dark mode"]
}
```

Use this to build a live autocomplete dropdown as the user types:

```js
let debounce;
input.addEventListener("input", () => {
  clearTimeout(debounce);
  debounce = setTimeout(async () => {
    const q = input.value.trim();
    if (q.length < 2) return clearSuggestions();
    const { suggestions } = await fetch(`/api/search/suggest?q=${encodeURIComponent(q)}`).then(r => r.json());
    renderSuggestions(suggestions);
  }, 150);
});
```

## Query analytics

Every search against `GET /api/search` is recorded fire-and-forget to a JSONL file at `{admin.runtimeDir}/search-analytics.jsonl`. The admin panel exposes aggregated statistics at:

```
GET /admin/api/search/analytics
```

Requires authentication with `pages.read` permission.

Response:

```json
{
  "totalSearches": 1842,
  "topQueries": [
    { "query": "deno", "count": 142, "avgResults": 7 },
    { "query": "forms", "count": 88, "avgResults": 3 }
  ],
  "zeroResultQueries": [
    { "query": "stripe integration", "count": 12 },
    { "query": "ecommerce", "count": 7 }
  ]
}
```

`zeroResultQueries` lists queries that returned no results on average — useful for discovering missing content.

The analytics file is machine-local and not git-tracked (it lives in `runtimeDir`). It is not pruned automatically — trim or rotate the file periodically on high-traffic sites.

## Build requirement

The search index is not built automatically in all contexts. In the standard `dune serve` / `dune dev` workflow, the index is built at startup. When using the programmatic API, call `search.build()` after the content index is ready:

```ts
const search = createSearchEngine({ pages, storage, contentDir, formats });
await search.build();  // required before calling search.search() or search.suggest()
```

Pass `customFields` to index additional frontmatter:

```ts
const search = createSearchEngine({
  pages, storage, contentDir, formats,
  customFields: ["summary", "author"],
});
await search.build();
```

## Limitations

- **In-memory only** — index is lost on restart and rebuilt fresh each time
- **No phrase matching** — `"hello world"` is treated as two separate terms
- **Published pages only** — unpublished pages are excluded from the index
- **No stemming** — "running" and "run" are distinct terms; prefix matching partially compensates

## Search UI

Dune also serves a public `/search` page that renders search results server-side. This lets visitors use search without JavaScript.

### How it works

1. A visitor opens `/search?q=deno`
2. Dune checks whether your active theme has a `templates/search.tsx` template
3. **If found** — the search template is rendered with the results injected as `searchQuery` and `searchResults` in `TemplateProps` (see [Templates](../../themes/templates))
4. **If not found** — Dune falls back to a built-in standalone page with minimal styling

The standalone fallback includes inline JavaScript that debounces queries against `/api/search` and updates the result list live as the user types, without a full page reload.

### Theme integration

Add a `templates/search.tsx` to your theme to control the layout:

```tsx
import type { TemplateProps } from "dune/types";

export default function SearchTemplate({ searchQuery, searchResults, site, Layout, ...props }: TemplateProps) {
  return (
    <Layout {...props} site={site}>
      <h1>Search</h1>
      <form action="/search" method="get">
        <input name="q" type="search" value={searchQuery ?? ""} />
        <button type="submit">Search</button>
      </form>

      {searchQuery && searchResults?.length === 0 && (
        <p>No results for "{searchQuery}".</p>
      )}

      <ul>
        {searchResults?.map((r) => (
          <li key={r.route}>
            <a href={r.route}>{r.title}</a>
            <p>{r.excerpt}</p>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

### `getSearchUrl` helper

The [Theme SDK](../../themes/theme-sdk) provides `getSearchUrl` to build links to the search page:

```ts
import { getSearchUrl } from "dune/theme-helpers";

getSearchUrl("deno")               // → "/search?q=deno"
getSearchUrl("hello world")        // → "/search?q=hello%20world"
getSearchUrl("deno", "/en/search") // → "/en/search?q=deno"  (multilingual sites)
```
