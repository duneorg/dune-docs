# Site Configuration

`config/site.yaml` defines your site's identity and content structure.

## Full reference

```yaml
# Site identity
title: "My Site"
description: "A site built with Dune CMS"
url: "https://example.com"

# Author
author:
  name: "Your Name"
  email: "you@example.com"        # optional

# HTML metadata (becomes <meta> tags)
metadata:
  og:type: "website"
  og:site_name: "My Site"
  twitter:card: "summary_large_image"

# Taxonomy types enabled for this site
taxonomies:
  - category
  - tag
  - author

# Route aliases (URL → URL)
routes:
  "/docs": "/documentation"
  "/blog/rss": "/api/feed"

# Redirects (301 by default)
redirects:
  "/old-page": "/new-page"
  "/legacy/post": "/blog/post"

# Home page slug override (optional — auto-detected if omitted)
home: "welcome"

# Additional CORS origins for the REST API (optional)
cors_origins:
  - "https://app.example.com"

# RSS & Atom feed settings (optional)
feed:
  enabled: true        # Set to false to disable /feed.xml and /atom.xml
  items: 20            # Number of most-recent dated pages to include
  content: "summary"   # "summary" (excerpt) or "full" (full HTML)

# Sitemap settings (optional)
sitemap:
  exclude:             # Route prefixes to omit from /sitemap.xml
    - "/private"
    - "/members"
  changefreq:          # Per-route changefreq overrides (longest prefix wins)
    "/": "hourly"
    "/blog": "daily"
```

## Key fields

### `title` and `description`

Your site's name and tagline. Used in templates and `<meta>` tags.

### `url`

The canonical base URL. Important for generating absolute URLs in sitemaps and Open Graph tags. Set this to your production domain.

### `taxonomies`

An array of taxonomy type names. This defines WHICH taxonomies your site uses. Content pages can then use any of these in their frontmatter `taxonomy` block.

Default: `["category", "tag"]`

### `home`

The slug of the page that serves as the site's home page (`/`). Optional — if omitted, Dune auto-detects the home page by taking the slug of the first ordered top-level page in the content tree. Falls back to `"home"` if no ordered pages exist.

Set this explicitly if Dune picks the wrong page, or if your home content folder has an unusual name:

```yaml
home: "start"   # serves /content/start/ at /
```

### `cors_origins`

Additional origins allowed to make cross-origin requests to the REST API. The origin derived from `site.url` is always permitted. Add extra origins for headless or decoupled frontends hosted on a different domain:

```yaml
cors_origins:
  - "https://app.example.com"
  - "https://staging.example.com"
```

Without this list, API requests from other domains will be blocked by the browser (CORS policy).

### `trusted_html`

By default, Dune sanitises raw HTML embedded in Markdown content to prevent stored XSS. Set this to `true` to disable sanitisation site-wide when your content is fully trusted (e.g. an internal site with no user-generated content):

```yaml
trusted_html: true
```

Individual pages can also opt out via `trusted_html: true` in their frontmatter without changing this global setting.

### `auto_discover_plugins`

By default, Dune does **not** automatically load TypeScript files found in `plugins/*.ts`. Plugins must be explicitly listed in `site.yaml` under `plugins:`. Set this to `true` to re-enable auto-discovery (legacy behaviour):

```yaml
auto_discover_plugins: true
```

Keeping this off (the default) limits the blast radius if an unexpected file lands in the plugins directory.

### `feed`

Controls RSS 2.0 and Atom 1.0 feed generation. See [RSS & Atom Feeds](../deployment/feeds) for full details.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `true` | Set to `false` to disable both feeds and hide `<link>` discovery tags |
| `items` | `20` | Number of most-recent dated pages to include |
| `content` | `"summary"` | `"summary"` (auto-generated excerpt) or `"full"` (fully rendered HTML) |

### `sitemap`

Controls sitemap generation. See [Sitemap](../deployment/sitemap) for full details.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `exclude` | `[]` | Route prefixes to omit from `/sitemap.xml`. Exact and prefix match. |
| `changefreq` | `{}` | Per-route `<changefreq>` overrides. Longest matching prefix wins. |

### `routes` and `redirects`

`routes` are aliases — both URLs serve the same content. `redirects` send visitors to a new URL with a 301 status. Use redirects for old URLs you want to retire; use routes for permanent alternative paths.
