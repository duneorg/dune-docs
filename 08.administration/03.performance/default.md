# Performance Monitoring

Dune's built-in performance monitor gives you operational visibility into your running server — request latency percentiles, memory usage, cache hit rates, and slow queries — without any external services or agents.

All data is in-process and resets on server restart. This is an operational tool, not long-term analytics.

---

## Dashboard

Navigate to **Admin → Performance** to see the live dashboard (refreshes every 30 seconds).

The dashboard shows:

- **Uptime** — how long the server has been running
- **Request stats** — total requests, error rate, p50/p95/p99 latency
- **Memory usage** — heap used/total and RSS in MB
- **Engine stats** — indexed page count, rebuild count, last rebuild time
- **Page cache stats** — entries, hit rate, eviction count (when page cache is enabled)
- **Top routes** — the 10 most-requested URLs with per-route latency
- **Slow queries** — last 20 collection or search queries that exceeded the threshold

---

## REST API

```
GET /admin/api/metrics
```

Requires admin role. Returns a full metrics snapshot as JSON.

  ]
}
```

## Configuration

```yaml
# system.yaml
metrics:
  enabled: true                # boolean — Enable metrics collector (default: true)
  slowQueryThresholdMs: 100    # number  — Log queries taking longer than this (default: 100)
```

To disable metrics collection entirely:

```yaml
metrics:
  enabled: false
```

---

## Latency percentiles

Latency is tracked using a fixed-size circular buffer (1,000 samples per route). When the buffer fills, the oldest sample is overwritten. Percentiles are computed from the current window on each snapshot request.

**Reading the numbers:**

- **p50** — half of requests complete faster than this
- **p95** — 95% of requests complete faster than this (a good general health indicator)
- **p99** — 99% of requests complete faster than this (highlights outliers)

All latency values are in **milliseconds**.

---

## Slow queries

Collection and search queries that exceed `slowQueryThresholdMs` are recorded. The last 20 are retained in memory and shown on the dashboard and in the API response.

If you see frequent slow queries, consider:
- Enabling the [in-process page cache](../deployment/caching) to reduce re-rendering
- Narrowing collection queries (add `filter` criteria, reduce `limit`)
- Checking for large content directories with many files

---

## Notes

- Metrics are in-process only — no files are written, no external services called
- Data resets on server restart
- `GET /admin/api/metrics` and the dashboard require **admin role**
- Metrics have no effect in `dune build --static` mode (no server to monitor)
