# Sitemap

Dune automatically generates an XML sitemap at `/sitemap.xml`. No configuration is required.

## What's included

The sitemap includes a page if ALL of the following are true:

- `published: true` in frontmatter
- The page has a routable URL (not a module/index-only page)
- All ancestor pages in the content tree are also published

Pages excluded from routing (module pages, pages with `published: false`, or pages whose parents are unpublished) are silently omitted.

## URL format

```
https://example.com/sitemap.xml
```

The base URL comes from `site.url` in `config/site.yaml`. Set this to your production domain to generate correct absolute URLs.

## Priority

Each URL's `<priority>` is calculated from its depth in the content tree:

```
priority = max(0.1, 1.0 − depth × 0.2)
```

| Depth | Example | Priority |
|-------|---------|----------|
| 0 (home) | `/` | 1.0 |
| 1 | `/blog` | 0.8 |
| 2 | `/blog/hello-world` | 0.6 |
| 3 | `/blog/2025/hello` | 0.4 |
| 4+ | deeper pages | 0.1 (floor) |

## Change frequency

Each URL includes a `<changefreq>` hint derived from its depth:

| Depth | `<changefreq>` |
|-------|----------------|
| 0 (home) | `daily` |
| 1 | `weekly` |
| 2+ | `monthly` |

This is a hint to crawlers and is not guaranteed to reflect actual update frequency.

Override the default for specific routes via `config/site.yaml`. The longest matching prefix wins:

```yaml
sitemap:
  changefreq:
    "/": "hourly"        # home page
    "/blog": "daily"     # /blog and all children unless more specific key matches
```

Valid values: `always` · `hourly` · `daily` · `weekly` · `monthly` · `yearly` · `never`

## Last modified date

Each URL's `<lastmod>` is the file modification time of the content file, formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`.

## Multilingual sites

For sites with more than one language configured (see [Multilingual Content](../../content/i18n)), the sitemap adds `xhtml:link` alternates to each URL entry:

```xml
<url>
  <loc>https://example.com/about</loc>
  <lastmod>2025-06-15</lastmod>
  <changefreq>weekly</changefreq>
  <priority>0.8</priority>
  <xhtml:link rel="alternate" hreflang="en" href="https://example.com/about"/>
  <xhtml:link rel="alternate" hreflang="de" href="https://example.com/de/about"/>
  <xhtml:link rel="alternate" hreflang="x-default" href="https://example.com/about"/>
</url>
```

Every language variant of a page is grouped by its source content path (with the language suffix stripped). Each variant gets the full set of `hreflang` alternates, and an `x-default` entry always points to the default-language URL.

## Excluding routes

To omit routes from the sitemap, add a `sitemap.exclude` list to `config/site.yaml`. Both exact matches and prefix matches are supported:

```yaml
sitemap:
  exclude:
    - "/private"    # excludes /private and /private/anything
    - "/members"
```

Pages whose routes start with any listed prefix are silently omitted.

## Cover images

If a page has an `image` frontmatter field set to a co-located image filename, the sitemap includes an `<image:image>` entry for that page:

```yaml
---
title: "My Post"
date: 2026-03-09
image: cover.jpg
---
```

This produces:

```xml
<url>
  <loc>https://example.com/blog/my-post</loc>
  ...
  <image:image>
    <image:loc>https://example.com/content-media/02.blog/01.my-post/cover.jpg</image:loc>
  </image:image>
</url>
```

The `xmlns:image` namespace attribute is added to `<urlset>` automatically when any image entries are present. See [Frontmatter Reference](../../content/frontmatter#media) for the `image` field.

## Generation timing

| Mode | When generated |
|------|---------------|
| `dune serve` | Once at startup, then cached |
| `dune dev` | Regenerated on each request |

In production (`dune serve`), the sitemap is built once when the server starts. Restart the server after adding or removing pages to update it.
