# Your First Page

## Start the dev server

If you haven't already, start the development server so you can see changes in real time:

```bash
deno task dev
```

The server starts at `http://localhost:8000` with hot-reload — every content or theme change is picked up automatically.

## Create a blog section

Create a folder for your blog and add a listing page:

```
content/
├── 01.home/
│   └── default.md
└── 02.blog/              ← new folder
    └── blog.md           ← listing page
```

The `02.` prefix controls ordering in navigation. The folder name `blog` becomes the URL: `/blog`.

Write `content/02.blog/blog.md`:

```markdown
---
title: "Blog"
visible: true
collection:
  items:
    "@self.children": true
  order:
    by: date
    dir: desc
---

# Blog

Welcome to my blog. Below you'll find my latest posts.
```

The `collection` in the frontmatter tells Dune to gather all child pages, sorted by date (newest first). This is a declarative query — no code needed.

## Add a blog post

```
content/02.blog/
├── blog.md
└── 01.hello-world/       ← new folder
    ├── post.md           ← your post
    └── cover.jpg         ← co-located media
```

Write `content/02.blog/01.hello-world/post.md`:

```markdown
---
title: "Hello World"
date: 2025-06-15
published: true
taxonomy:
  tag: [dune, first-post]
  category: [announcements]

# Hello World

This is my first blog post built with **Dune CMS**.

![Cover image](cover.jpg)

Content is just files. This Markdown file sits next to its images
in the same folder. No media library, no upload forms — just files.
```

Visit `/blog/hello-world` and you'll see your post, rendered through the `post.tsx` template from your theme.

## Key concepts to notice

1. **Folder = page**. The folder `01.hello-world/` IS the page. The `.md` file inside provides its content.
2. **Numeric prefix = order**. `01.hello-world` appears first in navigation. The number is stripped from the URL.
3. **Filename = template**. `post.md` renders with the `post.tsx` template. `blog.md` renders with `blog.tsx`. `default.md` renders with `default.tsx`.
4. **Co-located media**. `cover.jpg` lives next to `post.md`. Reference it with a plain relative path: `![alt](cover.jpg)`.
5. **Frontmatter = configuration**. YAML between `---` delimiters controls title, date, taxonomies, collections, and more.
6. **Collections are declarative**. `@self.children` gathers child pages. No code, no GraphQL, no database queries.
