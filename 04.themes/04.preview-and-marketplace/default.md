# Theme Preview & Marketplace

The admin panel lets you preview what your site looks like with a different theme before committing the switch, and install new themes directly from a curated registry.

## Previewing a theme

The Theme tab of the [configuration editor](../administration) (`/admin/config` → Theme tab) has a **Preview** button next to the theme dropdown.

1. Select a theme from the dropdown
2. Click **Preview** — an iframe opens showing your site rendered in that theme (without switching)
3. Use the route picker to preview different pages, or type a custom path
4. Click **↻ Refresh** if the preview needs reloading
5. Click **Apply this theme** to commit the switch, or **× Close** to dismiss without changing anything

The preview renders a real page through the selected theme's templates and layout — what you see is what you get. The active theme is not changed until you click Apply.

> **TSX pages:** Pages that are self-rendering TSX components (`.tsx` content files) cannot be fully previewed this way. They render themselves and can't have their layout swapped from the server. The preview will show a notice for these pages — check a Markdown page instead.

## Theme marketplace

The marketplace is at `/admin/themes` (also reachable from the "Browse more themes →" link at the bottom of the Theme tab).

### Installed themes

The **Installed** section shows every theme in your `themes/` directory:

- The currently active theme is marked with an **Active** badge
- **Preview** opens the config editor with that theme pre-selected in the preview panel
- **Set Active** switches the active theme (same as the Theme tab dropdown)

### Available from registry

The **Available** section lists themes from the bundled registry:

- Each card shows the name, description, tags, author, and version
- **Demo** links open the theme's demo site in a new tab
- **Install** downloads the theme ZIP from the registry and extracts it to `themes/{slug}/` on disk — no restart required
- Once installed, the theme moves to the Installed section and appears in the config editor dropdown

After installation you can immediately preview the new theme using the Preview button, then switch to it when ready.

### The bundled registry

Dune ships with a curated `src/admin/registry/themes.json` that lists community themes. The registry is updated with each Dune release. Support for custom registry URLs is planned for a future release.

The registry API is available at `GET /admin/api/registry/themes` for programmatic access (admin auth required).

### Install security

The install endpoint (`POST /admin/api/themes/install`) enforces:

- Theme slugs must match `/^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]*$/` — no path traversal via the slug
- Download URLs must use HTTPS
- ZIP entries with path traversal components (`../`) are rejected
- Files are written to `themes/{slug}/` only
